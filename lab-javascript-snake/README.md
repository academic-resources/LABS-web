In this Learning Unit, we are going to build the snake game, in which the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The player attempts to eat items by running into them with the head of the snake. Each item eaten makes the snake longer, so controlling is progressively more difficult.



## Summary

In this learning unit we created an Snake game by separating at first the logic from the rendering.
